# ☕ React Native Coffee App

This is a brand new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using the [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli), designed to bring the rich aroma and story of coffee to your fingertips.

Whether you're showcasing classic brews or curating a premium menu — this app is your canvas. Inspired by popular coffee styles like **Espresso**, **Latte**, **Cappuccino**, and **Cold Brew**, this app aims to serve both design and functionality in every line of code.

Install CocoaPods first (for first-time setup or after native dep updates):

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

Then run the app:
